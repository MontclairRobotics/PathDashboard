# PathDashboard
This is a GUI for planning auto using waypoints.
CLick the waypoints in the sequence you want and paste the code into your path router thing.
If you want to change where the waypoints are, enable tweaking mode. Paste it into the section of the code marked //Waypoint

# Future Updates
- export directly in pathplanner code
- add flip side
- sync with our real naming scheme
- make field the right aspect ratio
